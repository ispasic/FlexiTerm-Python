## [FlexiTerm](http://users.cs.cf.ac.uk/I.Spasic/flexiterm/): a software tool to automatically recognise multi-word terms in text documents.

FlexiTerm takes as input a corpus of ASCII documents and outputs a ranked list of automatically recognised multi-word terms.

If you use FlexiTerm in your work/research, please cite the following papers:

                        Default settings:
                        * pattern  : "(((((NN|JJ) )*NN) IN (((NN|JJ) )*NN))|((NN|JJ )*NN POS (NN|JJ )*NN))|(((NN|JJ) )+NN( CD)?)"

FlexiTerm takes as input a corpus of ASCII documents and outputs 
a ranked list of automatically recognised multi-word terms.

To run FlexiTerm:

1. Place input files (plain text only) into a folder named "text".

2. OPTIONAL: Replace file config/stoplist.txt with your own if needed.

3. Execute flexiterm.py from the command line: python flexiterm.py
   OR run the following Jupyter notebook: flexiterm.ipynb

4. Check the results by double-clicking out/terminology.html from which 
   you can navigate to out/concordances.html and then to out/corpus.html.
